Cartalog allows you to add product listings quickly and easily to any page on your Cart66 enabled site.

== Description ==

Cartalog is a companion plugin to the Cart66 product, the Lite or Pro version, you're choice.
It provides a quick and easy way to add product listings, by category, to any page
on your site. Using just a couple of shortcodes you can add product shots, links to detail pages,
descriptions and a fully capable Cart66 "Add to Cart" button. For multiple product categories you
can group items into category groups with nice headings and titles.

(Not to be confused with the iPad app of the same name by that fine Lucas Mendes Menge chap)

== Installation ==

1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
2. Read the documentation at [the web site](http://arbalestmedia.com/cartalog/ "Arbalest Media") for
   information on setting up and using the Cartalog shortcodes.
