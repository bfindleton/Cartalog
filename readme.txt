== Description ==

Cartalog is a companion plugin to the Cart66 product, the Lite or Pro version, you're choice.
It provides a quick and easy way to add product listings, by category if desired, to any page
on your site. Using just a couple of shortcodes you can add product shots, links to detail pages, descriptions and a fully capable Cart66 "Add to Cart" button. For multiple product categories you
can group items into category groups with nice headings and titles.

2. Read the documentation at [the web site](http://arbalestmedia.com/cartalog/ "Arbalest Media") for
